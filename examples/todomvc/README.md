# Simple TodoApp Example

This is a simple example of a todo app using typeful-redux. The todo app is quite simple. All code is in one file to simplify the overview. Code can be organized as desired (e.g. splitting reducers, store, components and containers).

## Setup

Use `npm` or `yarn` to install:

`$ npm install` or
`$ yarn install`

## Run

`$ npm start` runs the app via webpack-dev-server. Visit `localhost:8080`.
